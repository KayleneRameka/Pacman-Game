I have made a replica of the game PacMan made in Unity, following a tutorial by noobtuts (https://noobtuts.com/unity/2d-pacman-game) 

--------------------------------------------------------------------

###### Controls: <br />

Use arrow keys to move pacman around <br />


###### Tips: <br />
* When power pellets(big pac dots) are eaten, pacman will have 10secs to eat the ghosts, adding 200 points to your score. <br />
* Each pellet (4 in total) will be located in each corner of the map.<br />
