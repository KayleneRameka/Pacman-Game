A Pacman clone made in Unity, with tutorials from [noobtuts](http://noobtuts.com/unity/2d-pacman-game). In addition to the tutorial, [the original AI](http://gameinternals.com/post/2072558330/understanding-pac-man-ghost-behavior) is implemented as well as menus, a scoring system and a basic level progression system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

###### Controls: <br />

Use arrow keys to move pacman around <br />


###### Tips: <br />
* When power pellets(the fruit) are eaten, pacman will have 10 secs to eat the ghosts, adding 200 or so points to your score. <br />
* Each pellet (4 in total) will be located in each corner of the map.<br />
